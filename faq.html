        </p>
        <p><span class="a">A:</span> You need to close Panel Attack and delete the file that saves your input settings.
          On windows, you can type this into the start menu search to get to the right folder:

        <div class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack</div>

        then delete <span class="code">keysV2.txt</span>

        Thanks to gamerX459 for making a <a href="https://youtu.be/aQK0MKbNSkA" target="_blank">video demonstration</a>
        of how to fix the above problem.
        </p>

      <div>
        <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> How do I set Player 2's controls for local play in Panel Attack?</p>
        <p><span class="a">A:</span> While in the place for setting Player 1's controls, press right to get to Player
          2's controls.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> I have two computers. Can I use the same Panel Attack ranking system
          user_id on both, so all my matches get tracked to the same account?</p>
        <p><span class="a">A:</span> Yes, please do.
          <br>After you've logged into the Panel Attack server(s) once on your first computer, copy your "servers"
          folder to the appropriate location on your other computer.
          <br>Here are the folder locations, per operating system.
          <br><br>NOTE: replace "user" with whatever your operating system username is.
          <br>Windows 10, 8, 7, or Vista: <span class="code">C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Panel Attack</span> or search
          for <span class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack</span>
          <br>Mac: <span class="code">/Users/user/Library/Application Support/Panel Attack</span>
          <br>Linux: <span class="code">$XDG_DATA_HOME/Panel Attack</span> or <span
            class="code">~/.local/share/love/</span>
          <br>Windows XP <span class="code">C:\Documents</span> and <span class="code">Settings\user\Application
            Data\Panel Attack</span>
          <br>This folder contains your user_ids for each server, which Panel Attack uses to log in to the ranking
          system.

      <div>
        <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> The game seems to be going too fast!</p>

        <p><span class="a">A:</span> The menus may go too fast if you have a monitor that has a refresh rate greater
          than 60hz. We released an update to fix this mid April 2019, redownload the game if you haven't already since
          then.
          <br><br>Gameplay should be normal though. If the FPS counter shows about 60 during gameplay, and it seems like
          it's going too fast, it could be that you've set your L or R button (raise stack button) to a pressure
          sensitive trigger, and the game thinks you are constantly pressing that button. This happens especially on
          Xbox controllers. Use a button such as a bumper instead of a trigger.
        </p>

      <div>
        <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> How do I access replays?</p>

        <p><span class="a">A:</span> A local replay browser has been implemented.
          <br><br>Replays of all the games your client has played or spectated are stored as .txt files on your computer
          in <span class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack\replays</span>
          <br>Publicly saved replays are <a href="replays/" target="_blank">stored here</a>. You can adjust whether your
          replays are saved publicly in the Panel Attack options menu.
          They are arranged into folders by Panel Attack version, then date (UTC time), then player names.
          <br><br>Once you have the .txt file for the replay you want to watch, copy it to <span
            class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack\replays</span>, then relaunch panel attack and find it with the Replay
          Browser at the main menu.
